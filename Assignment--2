# PRACTICE  -- HISTOGRAM
# draw a random sample from standard normal distribution and store it in an object called rand 
rand <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
# open the graphical device, required to save the plot. We save it in the pdf format
pdf(“norm-hist.pdf")
# draw the histogram
hist(rand, col = rainbow(12), 
     main = "Histogram of 100 standard normal variates", 
     xlab = "rnorm(100)")
# close the graphical device
dev.off()
